## What to Look for Before Buying the Best Microwave Bump Out Kit

### Find Your Need - Compatibility and use case considerations
Before you purchase any kit, the most critical step is ensuring it matches your specific microwave model and cabinet depth. Check if you have a 30-inch or 36-inch cabinet opening and whether your cabinets are deeper than the standard 12 or 13 inches. Most bump-out kits are designed specifically for cabinets that are 15 inches deep. If you use a universal kit, double-check that your brand (Whirlpool, GE, LG, etc.) is listed in the compatible manufacturers to avoid installation headaches.

### Budget - Setting realistic price expectations ($15-$60 ranges)
Prices for these kits can vary significantly. Basic filler panels or generic mounting hardware can be found in the $15 to $30 range. These are often great for aesthetic fixes. However, if you need a structural OEM bump-out kit that includes specialized brackets for heavy units, expect to pay between $40 and $60. While it might be tempting to go for the cheapest option, the structural integrity of a genuine part is often worth the extra $20 for safety reasons.

### Key Features - Most important technical specifications
Look for kits made from heavy-duty steel or high-grade stainless steel. Plastic components should generally be avoided for mounting, though they are fine for decorative trim. Key features to look for include hand-adjustable panels, included installation screws (you'll often need 8 to 20 of them), and anti-rust coatings. If the kit is for a vent system, ensure it doesn't obstruct the microwave's airflow.

### Quality & Durability - What to look for in construction
A high-quality bump-out kit should feel rigid and have a consistent finish. If you are buying stainless steel, check for a protective film on the surface; this indicates the manufacturer cares about the product arriving scratch-free. Durability is especially important because the microwave will be producing heat and steam, so the metal must be corrosion-resistant to prevent rust over time.

### Brand Reputation - Importance of established manufacturers
While generic kits can be excellent, brands like Whirlpool or those specializing in appliance parts like Bagean or Obida have a reputation to uphold. Established manufacturers provide better engineering standards and often include warranties. If you are dealing with a heavy or high-end microwave, staying within the brand's ecosystem for mounting hardware is usually the safest path to ensure the warranty on the appliance itself remains valid.

### Portability/Size - Considerations for space and storage
Though these kits aren't portable once installed, the size during the installation phase matters. Ensure the panels aren't so long that they interfere with your back-splash or lighting. Measure the height, depth, and width of the gap you are trying to fill at least twice before ordering. Most standard heights are around 15 to 17 inches, but custom cabinets may require you to trim or adjust the pieces.

## Is it A Wise Decision to Buy microwave bump out kit?
Investing in a microwave bump out kit is an exceptionally wise decision for anyone living in a home with non-standard cabinet depths. Without these kits, a microwave might sit too far back, making it difficult to reach or causing the vent to blow directly onto the underside of your cabinets, which can lead to moisture damage and mold. Compared to the alternative of custom cabinet work, which can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars, a $50 kit is a bargain. 

Furthermore, these kits provide a long-term benefit by ensuring that your appliance is mounted securely. A poorly mounted microwave is a safety hazard, especially given the weight and the movement involved in opening and closing the door. By using a dedicated bump-out kit, you ensure that the weight is distributed properly across the wall studs and the cabinet frame. In the long run, this protects your kitchen infrastructure and maintains the resale value of your home by providing a professional, finished look that potential buyers will appreciate.

## What Is the Best Way to Choose microwave bump out kit?
Choosing the best kit requires a systematic approach. Start by identifying your microwave's model number and measuring your cabinet depth. If your cabinets are 15 inches deep, you specifically need a 15-inch bump-out kit. Next, decide if you need a functional mounting bracket or just a decorative trim. If your microwave is already hanging but there are gaps on the sides, a filler kit is what you need. If you haven't hung it yet and it doesn't reach the wall, you need a full bump-out mounting kit.

Always prioritize metal over plastic for any part that will bear weight. Professional tips include checking for the inclusion of all necessary hardware; some cheaper kits require you to go to the hardware store for screws. Avoid the mistake of ignoring the vent location; some kits can block the top-venting system of certain microwaves. If you have a premium appliance, always lean toward the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) option to ensure a perfect mechanical fit. If you are on a budget, universal stainless steel panels are a great middle-ground that offers durability without the high brand-name price tag.

**What is the best microwave bump out kit for beginners?**
For beginners, the Whirlpool Genuine OEM 15-inch kit is the best because it is designed to fit specific models perfectly, reducing the need for measuring and custom adjustments. The instructions are generally clearer than generic brands, and the fit is guaranteed if you have the right model, making the installation process much less stressful for a first-timer.

**How much should I spend on microwave bump out kit?**
You should expect to spend between $30 and $60. While you can find trim pieces for less, a proper mounting kit that provides structural support usually falls in this price range. Spending a little more on a high-quality metal kit is a good investment to ensure your heavy microwave stays securely on the wall.

**What features are most important in microwave bump out kit?**
The most important features are the material quality (stainless steel is best), compatibility with your specific brand, and the inclusion of all necessary mounting hardware. Additionally, look for kits that offer some adjustability, such as hand-bendable panels, which help account for slight irregularities in your kitchen cabinetry.

**How do I maintain my microwave bump out kit?**
Maintenance is simple. Since most are made of stainless steel, a quick wipe with a damp cloth and mild detergent is usually enough. For stainless steel kits, you can use a dedicated stainless steel cleaner once a month to keep the shine and prevent fingerprints from showing. Avoid using abrasive pads which can scratch the finish.

**Are expensive microwave bump out kit worth it?**
Yes, expensive kits are often worth it if they are OEM parts. These kits are engineered to the same safety and weight-bearing standards as the microwave itself. While you pay a premium, you gain peace of mind knowing the bracket won't fail and the fit will be seamless with your specific appliance model.

**What brands make the best microwave bump out kit?**
Whirlpool is the leader for genuine parts, especially for their own brands like Maytag and KitchenAid. For universal or replacement kits, brands like Bagean and Obida are highly regarded for their use of high-quality stainless steel and their broad compatibility with GE, LG, and Samsung models.

**How long do microwave bump out kit typically last?**
A well-installed metal bump-out kit should last as long as your microwave or even longer. Since they have no moving parts and are usually made of rust-resistant materials like coated steel or stainless steel, they can easily last 10 to 15 years without needing replacement.

**Can I find good microwave bump out kit on a budget?**
Yes, brands like Proretailer offer high-quality alternatives to OEM parts at a fraction of the cost. The key to buying on a budget is to ensure the material is still metal and that the reviews confirm the holes align correctly with standard microwave mounting points.
