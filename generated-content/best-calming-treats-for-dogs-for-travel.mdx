## What to Look for Before Buying the Best Calming Treats For Dogs For Travel

### Find Your Need
Consider the specific travel scenario you are facing. Is it a short car trip to the vet, or a long-haul flight? For car sickness, look for treats with ginger. For extreme noise like aircraft engines, a treat with higher melatonin or valerian root might be better. Consider your dog's age as well, as some formulas are not for puppies under 12 weeks.

### Budget
Calming treats vary widely in price. Expect to spend between $15 and $40 depending on the count and the quality of ingredients. A higher count jar, like 120 or 180 chews, usually offers the best price-per-serving. However, if you only travel once a year, a smaller 30-count pack might be more practical to ensure the ingredients remain fresh.

### Key Features
Look for active ingredients that have been scientifically studied for canine anxiety. These include Melatonin, L-Theanine (Suntheanine), L-Tryptophan, and herbal options like Chamomile or Ashwagandha. Check if the treat is non-drowsy if you plan on hiking or being active immediately after your travel.

### Quality & Durability
Quality refers to how the treats are processed and stored. Air-dried chews often retain more nutritional value than heat-processed ones. Durable packaging is also a must for travel; look for sturdy jars that won't get crushed in a travel bag. The NASC seal is a great indicator of high manufacturing standards.

### Brand Reputation
Stick with brands that are transparent about their sourcing and manufacturing. Companies like Native Pet, NaturVet, and Veterinary Formula have long histories of positive user feedback and veterinary backing. Read reviews to see how brands handle customer satisfaction and if they offer guarantees.

### Portability/Size
If you are flying, space is at a premium. Small soft chews in a resealable bag or a compact jar are ideal. Avoid large, bulky containers if you have limited luggage space. Some brands offer travel-friendly sizes specifically for this purpose.

## Is it A Wise Decision to Buy calming treats for dogs for travel?

Investing in calming treats is a wise decision because a stressed dog can be unpredictable and potentially dangerous during travel. High anxiety levels can lead to destructive behavior, excessive barking, or even physical illness like vomiting and diarrhea. By providing a calming supplement, you are not just making the journey easier for yourself, but you are significantly improving the quality of life for your pet.

Compared to heavy prescription sedatives, natural calming treats offer a gentler approach. They allow your dog to remain aware of their surroundings without the overwhelming fear. In the long term, reducing travel stress prevents the development of phobias, making future trips easier. While the cost may seem like an extra expense, the peace of mind and the physical safety of your pet far outweigh the price of a jar of chews.

## What Is the Best Way to Choose calming treats for dogs for travel?

To choose the right treat, start by testing them at home before your trip. This allows you to see how your dog reacts to the ingredients and find the perfect dosage. Always check the ingredient list for potential allergens like grain or soy if your dog has a sensitive stomach.

Professional tips include looking for the NASC seal and checking for ingredients like ginger for motion sickness. Avoid treats with artificial colors or fillers that offer no nutritional value. If your dog is particularly picky, choose a meat-first flavor like bacon or chicken. If budget is a concern, calculate the price per chew rather than just looking at the total jar price. Finally, consult your vet if your dog is on other medications to ensure there are no interactions with the calming agents.
