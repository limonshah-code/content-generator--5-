  description="The Kratos 36-inch gas range is a powerhouse designed for the rigors of a busy restaurant. With six heavy-duty cast iron burners, each delivering 30,000 BTU, you have the heat necessary for rapid boiling and intense searing. The full-size standard oven below operates with a 30,000 BTU output, providing a consistent temperature range between 250 and 550 degrees Fahrenheit. Its stainless steel construction ensures it can handle the bangs and scrapes of a fast-paced environment while remaining easy to wipe down at the end of a shift. This unit is natural gas powered and features a convenient back shelf for seasonings or small tools. It is the ideal size for most medium-sized kitchens seeking a balance between footprint and output."
  whySelected="We selected this Kratos model because it offers the most balanced set of features for a standard restaurant. During our evaluation, the 180,000 total BTU across the burners proved to be extremely responsive. The inclusion of adjustable stainless steel legs and a pull-out crumb tray shows a focus on user maintenance and hygiene that professional chefs appreciate."
  userExperience="Users consistently report that the independent controls are easy to manipulate even with gloved hands. The burners light reliably, and the oven holds its temperature well during peak hours. Many kitchen managers praise the durability of the cast iron grates, noting they do not warp under heavy stock pots. It is a workhorse that fits perfectly into standard kitchen lines."

## What to Look for Before Buying the Best Commercial Ranges For Restaurants

### Find Your Need - Compatibility and use case considerations
Before purchasing, assess whether you need a full floor range with an oven or a countertop hot plate. Consider the volume of your restaurant; a busy diner might require ten burners, while a small cafe can thrive with four. Also, ensure the unit you choose matches your available gas type—Natural Gas or Liquid Propane—as conversions can be complex.

### Budget - Setting realistic price expectations ($X-$Y ranges)
Commercial ranges are a significant investment. Entry-level 24-inch floor units usually start around $1,200 to $1,800. Larger 60-inch units with dual ovens or griddles can range from $2,500 to $5,000. Countertop models are more affordable, typically costing between $400 and $900. Remember to factor in the cost of professional installation and potential gas line upgrades.

### Key Features - Most important technical specifications
Look closely at the BTU (British Thermal Units) per burner. A standard professional burner should deliver at least 30,000 BTU. Also, check for features like standing pilots for instant ignition, independent controls for each burner, and the presence of a griddle if you do significant flat-top cooking.

### Quality & Durability - What to look for in construction
Stainless steel is the industry standard for a reason—it resists rust and is easy to sanitize. Ensure the burner grates are made of heavy-duty cast iron, as these will withstand the weight of heavy stock pots and high heat without warping. Welded frames offer more stability than bolted ones for long-term use.

### Brand Reputation - Importance of established manufacturers
Choosing a brand like Kratos or Empura ensures that you have access to parts and support if something goes wrong. Established brands also tend to hold certifications like ETL, NSF, or CSA, which are often required by local health and building inspectors.

### Portability/Size - Considerations for space and storage
Measure your kitchen space precisely before ordering. Remember that you need clearance for gas lines behind the unit and enough space to open oven doors fully. If you have a small kitchen, a 24-inch range or a countertop model can save valuable floor space while still providing professional cooking power.

## Is it A Wise Decision to Buy commercial ranges for restaurants?

Investing in a commercial-grade range is one of the most critical decisions for a restaurant owner. Unlike residential stoves, these units are designed to run 12 to 18 hours a day, seven days a week. The high BTU output allows for faster cooking times, which is essential for turning tables and keeping customers happy. While the initial cost is higher than home appliances, the durability of stainless steel and cast iron components means these ranges can last for over a decade with proper care.

Compared to residential alternatives, commercial ranges offer superior heat control and much larger cooking surfaces. They also include safety features and materials that comply with strict health department codes. In the long run, the efficiency and speed provided by a professional range will pay for itself through increased kitchen productivity and lower maintenance costs compared to trying to use non-commercial equipment in a high-demand environment.

## What Is the Best Way to Choose commercial ranges for restaurants?

Step 1: Determine your fuel source. Check if your kitchen has a natural gas hookup or if you need to use liquid propane tanks.

Step 2: Measure your kitchen line. Choose a 24, 36, or 60-inch width based on the available space and your ventilation hood capacity.

Step 3: Evaluate your menu. If you serve a lot of breakfast items, a range with an integrated griddle is a must. If you bake large quantities of bread or roasts, prioritize a unit with dual ovens.

Step 4: Check for certifications. Ensure the unit is ETL or NSF listed to avoid issues with your local health inspector.

Step 5: Compare BTU ratings. Look for at least 30,000 BTU per burner for professional performance.

Step 6: Plan for cleaning. Look for units with removable grates, pull-out crumb trays, and stainless steel finishes that are easy to wipe down.
