## What to Look for Before Buying the Best 20 Built In Microwave

Choosing the right built-in microwave involves more than just picking a model that looks good. It's an investment in your kitchen's functionality. Here’s a detailed guide to help you make an informed choice.

### Find Your Need - Compatibility and use case considerations
First, assess how you'll use the microwave. Are you a busy professional who mainly reheats coffee and leftovers? Or are you part of a large family that uses it for defrosting, cooking full meals, and popping popcorn? Your usage will determine the features you need. Also, consider compatibility. A built-in microwave needs to fit precisely into your cabinetry. Measure the cutout space (width, height, and depth) carefully before you start shopping. For over-the-range (OTR) models, ensure your kitchen has the proper ventilation setup, either external or recirculating.

### Budget - Setting realistic price expectations
Built-in microwave prices can vary significantly. Basic, smaller models can start around $300, while high-end microwave drawers or models with convection cooking and advanced sensors can exceed $1,500. Set a realistic budget based on your needs. A mid-range model between $500 and $900 will typically offer a great balance of features, including sensor cooking, decent capacity, and reliable power. Remember to factor in the potential cost of a trim kit if it's not included, which can add another $100-$300.

### Key Features - Most important technical specifications
-   **Wattage:** Power, measured in watts, determines cooking speed. Most microwaves range from 800 to 1200 watts. For a built-in model, aim for at least 1000 watts for efficient and even cooking.
-   **Capacity:** Measured in cubic feet, capacity ranges from around 1.0 cu. ft. to over 2.0 cu. ft. A family of four will likely need at least 1.5 cu. ft. to accommodate larger dishes.
-   **Sensor Cooking:** This is a must-have feature. It uses sensors to detect steam and humidity, automatically adjusting cooking time and power for perfect results without guesswork.
-   **Inverter Technology:** Unlike traditional microwaves that cycle power on and off, inverter technology delivers a continuous, steady stream of power for more even cooking and defrosting.
-   **Convection Cooking:** Some high-end models include a convection fan, allowing them to function as a second oven for baking, roasting, and browning.
-   **Turntable:** A rotating turntable ensures food cooks evenly. Look for models with a large turntable or the option to turn it off to fit rectangular dishes.

### Quality & Durability - What to look for in construction
A built-in microwave should last for years. Look for models with a stainless steel interior, which is more durable, easier to clean, and resists odors better than plastic. Check the door construction; it should feel solid and close securely. Reading user reviews can provide valuable insight into the long-term durability of a specific model and the quality of its components.

### Brand Reputation - Importance of established manufacturers
Stick with well-known brands like Panasonic, Frigidaire, Empava, and Farberware. These companies have a long history of producing reliable appliances and typically offer better customer service and warranty support. A strong warranty (like Empava's 2-year warranty) can be a good indicator of a manufacturer's confidence in their product.

### Portability/Size - Considerations for space and storage
While "portability" isn't a factor for built-in models, size is critical. Double-check your cabinet cutout dimensions. Standard widths are often 24, 27, or 30 inches. Pay close attention to the required depth to ensure the unit will sit flush with your cabinetry. Consider the door swing as well; make sure there's enough clearance for it to open fully without hitting walls or other appliances. For microwave drawers, ensure the location is convenient and accessible for all members of the household.

## Is it A Wise Decision to Buy 20 built in microwave?

Investing in a built-in microwave is a wise decision for homeowners looking to enhance both the functionality and aesthetics of their kitchen. Unlike a countertop model that consumes valuable prep space, a built-in unit integrates seamlessly into your cabinetry, creating a custom, high-end look. This streamlined appearance not only declutters your kitchen but can also increase your home's resale value.

From a performance standpoint, built-in microwaves are often more powerful and feature-rich than their countertop counterparts. They typically offer higher wattages, larger capacities, and advanced technologies like sensor cooking, inverter systems, and even convection capabilities, effectively serving as a secondary oven. Over-the-range models add another layer of utility by combining cooking with a ventilation system, clearing smoke and odors from your stovetop.

While the initial cost is higher than a standard countertop microwave, the long-term benefits are substantial. You gain a more organized, efficient, and visually appealing kitchen space. The durable construction of these units means they are built to last, making the investment a lasting upgrade to your home's most important room. For anyone undertaking a kitchen remodel or simply looking to elevate their cooking environment, a built-in microwave is a practical and stylish choice.

## What Is the Best Way to Choose 20 built in microwave?

Choosing the best built-in microwave requires a methodical approach to ensure it meets your specific needs. Follow this step-by-step guide for a confident purchase.

**Step 1: Measure Your Space Twice**
Accuracy is crucial. Before looking at any models, carefully measure the width, height, and depth of the cabinet cutout where the microwave will be installed. Note these dimensions and bring them with you when shopping. Don’t forget to check the manufacturer’s specifications for required clearance space around the unit for ventilation.

**Step 2: Define Your Primary Use**
Consider your daily habits. Do you need a large-capacity model for family meals? Is advanced technology like inverter or sensor cooking important for your cooking style? Or is a simple, reliable unit for reheating sufficient? Creating a list of must-have features will help you narrow down the options.

**Step 3: Set Your Budget**
Determine how much you are willing to spend. Remember to account for the cost of a trim kit if it's sold separately, as well as potential installation costs if you aren't doing it yourself. Having a clear budget prevents you from overspending on features you may not need.

**Step 4: Research and Compare Models**
Use your list of features and dimensions to compare models from reputable brands. Read expert reviews (like this guide) and customer feedback to get a sense of real-world performance and long-term reliability. Pay attention to comments about noise level, ease of use, and cleaning.

**Step 5: Consider the Aesthetics**
The microwave should complement your kitchen's design. Choose a finish—stainless steel, black, or white—that matches your other appliances. For a truly integrated look, a microwave drawer or a model with a sleek, minimalist control panel can make a significant impact.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
-   **Ignoring Cutout Dimensions:** Buying a microwave that doesn’t fit is a costly and frustrating mistake.
-   **Forgetting the Trim Kit:** Many built-in models require a specific trim kit for a finished look. Confirm whether it's included or a separate purchase.
-   **Overlooking Power:** A microwave with less than 1000 watts may cook slowly and unevenly.

**When to Upgrade vs. Budget Options:**
Upgrade to a premium model with features like convection cooking or a drawer design if you are doing a full kitchen remodel, need a secondary oven, or highly value a streamlined aesthetic. Stick to a budget-friendly over-the-range or standard built-in model if you are replacing an old unit and need solid, reliable performance without all the bells and whistles.
