## What to Look for Before Buying the Best Infrared Grills

Choosing the right infrared grill requires careful consideration of several factors. From size and power to materials and features, understanding what to look for will ensure you get a grill that meets your needs and provides years of delicious meals.

### Find Your Need - Compatibility and use case considerations
Before you start shopping, think about how you plan to use your grill. Are you a weekend warrior who hosts large backyard parties? A full-size cabinet grill like the Charbroil 4-Burner or Veralune 4+1 Burner would be ideal. If you live in an apartment with a small balcony or love to go camping and tailgating, a portable model like the BIG HORN OUTDOORS broilers is a much better fit. Consider the types of food you cook most often. If steak is your passion, a high-heat broiler is perfect. If you want versatility for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, a modular system with a griddle option is the way to go.

### Budget - Setting realistic price expectations ($X-$Y ranges)
Infrared grills come in a wide range of prices. You can find excellent portable, high-heat broilers for around $150 to $250. Compact, high-performance cabinet grills typically fall in the $400 to $600 range. For large, premium, feature-packed models with multiple burners and stainless steel construction, expect to pay anywhere from $600 to $900 or more. Set a realistic budget, but remember that investing a little more in build quality and features can lead to better performance and a longer lifespan for your grill.

### Key Features - Most important technical specifications
- **BTU (British Thermal Units):** This measures heat output. While a higher BTU can mean faster heating, efficiency is more important. A well-designed infrared system can cook effectively with a lower BTU rating, saving fuel. Look for a balance of power and efficiency.
- **Cooking Surface Area:** Measured in square inches, this determines how much food you can cook at once. A primary area of 300-400 sq. in. is good for small families, while 500+ sq. in. is better for entertaining.
- **Ignition System:** Most modern grills use an electronic or pulse ignition system, which is safer and more reliable than using matches.
- **Extra Burners:** A side burner, especially an infrared one, adds immense versatility for searing, simmering sauces, or preparing side dishes.

### Quality & Durability - What to look for in construction
The materials used in a grill's construction are critical for its longevity. Look for high-grade stainless steel for the body, lid, and burners, as it resists rust and corrosion. For cooking grates, porcelain-coated cast iron is an excellent choice because it retains heat incredibly well, is naturally non-stick, and is resistant to chipping and rust. Check for a sturdy frame, heavy-duty wheels, and a well-constructed lid that seals tightly to retain heat.

### Brand Reputation - Importance of established manufacturers
Sticking with reputable brands like Charbroil often means better quality control, more reliable performance, and better customer support. Established manufacturers typically offer stronger warranties, like the 10-year burner warranty on the Charbroil Pro Series, which is a great indicator of the company's confidence in their product. They also tend to have a wider availability of replacement parts and accessories.

### Portability/Size - Considerations for space and storage
Always measure your available space before buying a grill. For large cabinet models, account for clearance on all sides for safety and a prep area. If space is tight, look for features like folding side shelves, which can significantly reduce the grill's storage footprint. For portable models, consider the weight and dimensions to ensure it's easy to transport and will fit in your car or RV.

## Is it A Wise Decision to Buy infrared grills?

Investing in an infrared grill is a wise decision for anyone who values flavor, efficiency, and consistency in their cooking. Unlike traditional convection grills that circulate hot air, infrared grills use radiant heat to cook food directly. This method is far more efficient, leading to significantly faster preheating times and reduced fuel consumption. The primary benefit, however, is the quality of the food. Infrared heat locks in moisture by searing the outside of the meat quickly, resulting in juicier steaks, chicken, and burgers. This technology also virtually eliminates flare-ups, as drippings are instantly vaporized instead of igniting into flames that can char your food and create bitter flavors.

Compared to standard gas grills, infrared models offer superior temperature control and more even heating across the entire cooking surface, banishing hot and cold spots. While the initial cost might be slightly higher than a basic gas or charcoal grill, the long-term benefits are substantial. You will save money on fuel, waste less food due to better cooking results, and enjoy a restaurant-quality experience at home. For those who are serious about grilling, the leap to infrared technology is a justifiable investment that pays dividends in every succulent bite.

## What Is the Best Way to Choose infrared grills?

Choosing the best infrared grill involves a thoughtful process that matches your specific needs with the right product. Following a step-by-step approach can help you make a confident and satisfying purchase.

1.  **Assess Your Primary Use Case:** First, define what you'll be doing most. Are you searing steaks for two on a balcony, or are you hosting full family barbecues? This will determine the size and type of grill you need, from a compact portable broiler to a large multi-burner cabinet model.

2.  **Determine Your Space and Storage:** Measure the area where you plan to use and store the grill. Ensure there is adequate ventilation and safety clearance. For smaller spaces, look for models with space-saving features like folding side shelves.

3.  **Set a Realistic Budget:** Decide how much you are willing to spend. Remember that a higher price often correlates with better materials, more features, and a longer warranty. Factor in the cost of a propane tank and any essential accessories like a cover or griddle top.

4.  **Prioritize Key Features:** Make a list of must-have features. Is an infrared side burner for searing important? Do you want the versatility of a modular griddle system? Do you need a large warming rack? Focusing on what matters most to you will help narrow down the options.

**Professional Tips:**
- **Look at the Grates:** Heavy, porcelain-coated cast iron or thick stainless steel grates are a sign of quality. They retain heat better and last longer.
- **Check the Warranty:** A long warranty, especially on the burners and firebox, indicates a manufacturer's confidence in their product's durability.
- **Don't Just Chase BTUs:** A well-engineered grill with efficient infrared emitters will outperform a poorly designed grill with a higher BTU rating. Focus on technology like Charbroil's Amplifire system over raw numbers.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- **Buying Too Big or Too Small:** A grill that's too large for your needs wastes fuel and space, while one that's too small is frustrating when you have guests.
- **Ignoring Build Quality:** Don't be swayed by a low price tag on a flimsy grill. A wobbly frame or thin metal construction will not stand up to the elements or high heat.
- **Forgetting Accessories:** A quality grill cover is not an option; it's a necessity to protect your investment. Budget for it from the start.

## FAQ

### What is the best infrared grills for beginners?
For beginners, the Charbroil Pro Series 2-Burner Infrared Gas Grill is an excellent choice. Its Amplifire technology is very forgiving, as it prevents flare-ups that can easily ruin a meal. This helps build confidence and allows new grillers to focus on cooking times and temperatures. Its compact size is manageable, and the straightforward operation makes it easy to learn on without feeling overwhelmed by too many features.

### How much should I spend on infrared grills?
You can expect to spend between $200 for a portable steak broiler and $700+ for a large, feature-rich cabinet grill. A great sweet spot for most home users is in the $400-$600 range, which gets you a high-quality, durable grill like the Charbroil Pro Series with excellent technology and a good warranty. Spending more typically gets you more cooking space, higher-grade materials like stainless steel, and additional features like side burners.

### What features are most important in infrared grills?
The most important feature is the quality of the infrared cooking system itself. Look for systems that promise even heating and flare-up prevention. After that, durable materials like stainless steel and porcelain-coated cast iron grates are crucial for longevity and performance. Finally, consider convenience features that fit your lifestyle, such as a reliable ignition system, adequate prep space, and easy-to-clean components.

### How do I maintain my infrared grills?
Maintenance is key to a long grill life. Always clean the grates after each use with a good grill brush. Regularly empty and clean the grease trap to prevent buildup. Periodically, do a deep clean by removing the grates and emitters to clear any debris. Always keep your grill covered with a high-quality, waterproof cover when not in use to protect it from the elements.

### Are expensive infrared grills worth it?
Yes, often they are. More expensive grills typically use higher-grade stainless steel, have more robust construction, and offer better warranties. They also tend to include more powerful burners and premium features like infrared side burners and modular cooking systems. If you are a serious griller and use your grill frequently, investing in a more expensive model will pay off in terms of performance, durability, and overall cooking enjoyment.

### What brands make the best infrared grills?
Charbroil is a leader in the consumer infrared grill market with its well-regarded Amplifire (formerly TRU-Infrared) technology, offering a great balance of performance and value. Brands like BIG HORN OUTDOORS specialize in high-heat portable broilers perfect for searing. Other high-end brands also incorporate infrared technology, but Charbroil makes it accessible to a wider audience.

### How long do infrared grills typically last?
A well-maintained infrared grill from a reputable brand can last anywhere from 5 to 15 years. The lifespan depends heavily on the quality of the materials, how often it's used, and how well it's protected from the elements. Grills with stainless steel burners and bodies and cast iron grates will generally last much longer than those made with cheaper materials. Regular cleaning and using a cover are the best ways to maximize its lifespan.

### Can I find good infrared grills on a budget?
Absolutely. While high-end models can be pricey, brands have made infrared technology more accessible. Portable models like the BIG HORN OUTDOORS Infrared Broiler offer incredible searing power for a relatively low cost. For a traditional grill, looking for a smaller 2-burner model or waiting for seasonal sales can help you get the benefits of infrared grilling without a massive investment.
