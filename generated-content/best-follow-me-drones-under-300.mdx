## What to Look for Before Buying the Best Follow Me Drones Under 300

### 1. Find Your Need - Compatibility and use case considerations
Before you hit the buy button, consider what you actually want to do with your drone. If you are a solo traveler, a strong follow-me function and a compact, foldable design are your top priorities. For those who want to film family events, camera resolution and stability like EIS are more important. Always check if the drone app is compatible with your specific smartphone model to avoid software headaches.

### 2. Budget - Setting realistic price expectations ($150-$300 ranges)
In the sub-300 range, you can expect a wide variety of quality. Drones closer to 150 often use brushed motors and lack true 4K resolution. Stepping up to the 250 to 300 range usually gets you brushless motors, longer flight times, and sometimes even integrated screens on the remote. Investing a little more upfront often saves money on repairs and battery replacements in the long run.

### 3. Key Features - Most important technical specifications
Look for drones with GPS and GLONASS for the most stable outdoor positioning. Brushless motors are a must for longevity and wind resistance. Flight time should ideally be over 25 minutes per battery, and the drone should include at least two batteries. For the best video, prioritize models with EIS or at least a remotely adjustable camera tilt.

### 4. Quality & Durability - What to look for in construction
Since you will likely be using this outdoors, the build quality matters. Look for high-density ABS plastic frames that can withstand minor impacts. Check for the inclusion of propeller guards, especially if you are a beginner. A good carrying case is also a sign of a manufacturer that cares about the longevity of the product.

### 5. Brand Reputation - Importance of established manufacturers
While many brands in this space might be new to you, look for those with active customer support and clear tutorial videos. Brands like Scrubuz and PLEGBLE have established a presence by providing consistent updates and responsive US-based support teams. Avoid nameless generic models that don't have a dedicated app on the official app stores.

### 6. Portability/Size - Considerations for space and storage
Most modern drones in this category are foldable, but some are much smaller than others. If you plan to hike long distances, every gram counts. Drones under 249g are not only easier to carry but also exempt you from many FAA registration requirements in the USA, making your hobby much simpler to manage.

## Is it A Wise Decision to Buy follow me drones under 300?

Investing in a follow-me drone under 300 is an excellent decision for hobbyists and creators who want professional features without the thousand-dollar price tag. Just a few years ago, features like 4K video, GPS auto-return, and intelligent AI tracking were reserved for high-end professional rigs. Today, these technologies have matured and become affordable for the average consumer. 

By choosing a drone in this price bracket, you get a device that is sophisticated enough to capture usable footage for social media or personal memories while remaining easy to operate. Compared to expensive alternatives, these drones are less stressful to fly because the financial risk is lower if an accident occurs. Furthermore, many of these models use standard parts and modular batteries, which makes them easier to maintain over several years. For most users, the jump in quality from a toy drone to a sub-300 GPS drone is the most significant performance gain they will ever experience.

## What Is the Best Way to Choose follow me drones under 300?

To choose the perfect drone, start by verifying the motor type. Always opt for brushless motors as they are more efficient, quieter, and last significantly longer than brushed ones. Next, check the weight; staying under 249 grams saves you from the hassle of FAA registration and Remote ID requirements. 

Follow these steps for a successful selection:
- Compare the total flight time provided by all included batteries.
- Look for EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization) if you plan on recording video while moving.
- Determine if you prefer using your phone as a screen or if you want a built-in display on the remote.
- Read user reviews specifically regarding the stability of the GPS signal in your region.
- Avoid drones that do not offer an auto-return home feature, as this is your primary insurance against losing the device.
- Check for the availability of spare parts like propellers and extra batteries online.

## FAQ

### What is the best follow me drones under 300 for beginners?
The PLEGBLE PL-715 is widely considered one of the best for beginners due to its dedicated Beginner Mode and very stable GPS hovering. It limits how far the drone can fly while you are learning the ropes, which significantly reduces the chance of a crash or losing the signal.

### How much should I spend on follow me drones under 300?
If you want a reliable experience with brushless motors and 4K capabilities, expect to spend between 200 and 280. Drones under 150 often lack the GPS precision required for a truly reliable follow-me experience and may struggle in windy conditions.

### What features are most important in follow me drones under 300?
The most critical features are GPS positioning for safety, brushless motors for power, and a high-quality camera with some form of stabilization. A dual battery setup is also highly recommended so you can enjoy more than 20 minutes of flying per session.

### How do I maintain my follow me drones under 300?
Always wipe down the drone after flying in dusty or humid environments. Check the propellers for chips or cracks before every flight, and replace them immediately if damaged. Store your batteries at a partial charge rather than fully empty or fully full if you are not flying for more than a week.

### Are expensive follow me drones under 300 worth it?
Yes, models at the top of this price range usually include Electronic Image Stabilization and integrated screens. These features vastly improve the user experience and the quality of the footage you capture, making the extra investment worthwhile for serious hobbyists.

### What brands make the best follow me drones under 300?
Brands like Scrubuz, PLEGBLE, and LAKSAKI currently lead the market in this specific price segment. They offer a good balance of hardware quality and software features, backed by decent customer support and instructional content.

### How long do follow me drones under 300 typically last?
With proper care and brushless motors, these drones can last for several years. The most common point of failure is the battery, which usually needs replacement after 200 to 300 charge cycles. Keeping the firmware updated also helps extend the product life.

### Can I find good follow me drones under 300 on a budget?
Absolutely. There are many excellent options around the 200 mark that offer 2K or 4K photo capabilities and reliable GPS tracking. While they may have slightly shorter flight times than the 300 models, they still provide a great flying experience.
